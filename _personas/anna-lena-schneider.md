Anna-Lena Schneider is a coder by heart, caring deeply about the code quality of the work she’s doing in Bonn, Germany. She is passionate about web accessibility and learned about it when still in high school when she attended a summer hackathon event that encouraged girls to study programming and participate in technology events.  One of the community volunteers was a blind woman who expertly used a screen reader and Anna-Lena was made aware of the power and importance of accessibility.

In her current job as a Senior Programmer in a financial services company, Anna-Lena’s main concern is providing a good user experience for all people. However she is facing some obstacles as German laws do not require accessibility. To persuade the team and management to invest the time, she is in need of good justification.  She does not like to refer them to the WAI website because it “just doesn’t look good.” In addition to technical support, she is looking for arguments and resources that will not just make her colleagues agree but will energize and motivate them. While she, as developer, is able to easily read and understand information in English, she thinks it would be easier to convince people on the importance of accessibility if the information was available in her native language, German. Anna-Lena is single, and a world traveler, regularly booking urban as well as nature vacations such as last year’s trip to the Galapagos. When at home she goes to cinema and music concerts nearly every week with her friends.
